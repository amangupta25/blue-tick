**Extension CLI is a command-line application that facilitates chromium&#8727;-based web extension development by providing
a systematic way to build, test and document extension projects. It handles the project setup and builds and lets you focus 
on the extension you are creating.**

## Motivation

After developing multiple browser extensions, it became clear that there are several steps in the development process that stay the same between every project. 

Instead of setting up these tasks individually for each project, it made more sense to combine everything in a utility tool that could be shared between projects. 

This approach helps with creating a common, consistent development approach between multiple projects, reduces time to get started, and makes it easier to update build tools and scripts across multiple projects as many npm packages inevitably need to be updated (frequently!).
