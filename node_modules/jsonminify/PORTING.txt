As you can see comparing the PHP port to the original JS code, 
the spirit of what I want to do is implement the code in as 
similar a code algorithm as possible for now, until we're more 
sure the algorithm is either solid (bug free) or perhaps we 
decide on a better universal algorithm. 

But the more similar the code algorithm implementations are, 
the easier it will be to maintain the various ports if changes 
must occur.
 
In as much as possible, my preference is to use core/built-in 
parts of each language rather than plugins. That lets the most 
people have a chance to use it. If that's not practical in some 
situation, fine, document it. But if possible, that's preferred.
 
The test.minify.html file shows 4 different test inputs which 
exercise the algorithm and show the correct outputs. Those same 
tests should pass on the ports, obviously.
 
Process would just be to fork this repo and add the files, in 
the style of "minify.json.rb" for ruby, for instance, and then 
send me a pull request.
